for a category of uncertain nonstrict-feedback systems with input 
saturation and output constraint. A variable separation approach is 
introduced to overcome the difficulty arising from the 
nonstrict-feedback structure. The problem of input saturation is solved 
by introducing an auxiliary design system, and output constraint is 
handled by utilizing a barrier Lyapunov function. Combing fuzzy logic 
system with the adaptive backstepping technique, the semi-global 
boundedness of all variables in the closed-loop systems is guaranteed, 
and the tracking error is driven to the origin with a small 
neighborhood. The stability of the closed-loop systems is proved, and 
the simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach.},

the sliding surface function is formed linearly with the system states

sliding surface reachable with the existence of the system perturbations
 to make the augmented system stable. Finally, simulation results are

<br>  abstract={This paper investigates fuzzy adaptive output feedback 
optimal control problem for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear 
systems. With the help of fuzzy logic systems approximating the unknown 
nonlinear functions and cost function, the unmeasured states are 
estimated by designing fuzzy adaptive state observer. Combining state 
observer with backstepping design technique, a feedforward controller is
 designed. Based on the designed feedforward control strategy, the 
controlled nonlinear system can be converted to an equivalence nonlinear
 system in affine-form. Finally, a fuzzy adaptive optimal controller 
with parameters adaptive laws is developed. The whole control scheme 
consists of a feedforward controller and a feedback optimal controller. 
It is shown that the proposed output feedback optimal control approach 
can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded,

<br>  year={2017},
<br>  volume={47},

<br>  pages={58-69},
<br>  abstract={Dimension reduction is frequently adopted as a data 
preprocessing technique to facilitate data visualization, 
interpretation, and classification. Traditional dimension reduction 
methods such as linear discriminant analysis focus on maximizing the 
overall discrimination between all classes, which may be easily affected
 by outliers. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper proposes a novel
 method for multiclass dimension reduction, named dimension reduction by
 minimum error minimax probability machine (DR-MEMPM). It elaborately 
ensures that each pair of classes is well separated in the projected 
subspace by utilizing the separation probability between different 
pairwise classes. Therefore, it can put more emphasis on those less 
distinguishable classes, and the learned projection will not be 
dominated by some “outlier” classes which lie far away from other 
classes. We evaluate the proposed DR-MEMPM on a number of synthetic and 
real-world data sets, and show that it outperforms other 
state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods in terms of visual 
intuition and classification accuracy, especially when the distances 
between classes are unevenly distributed.},

<br>  number={1},
<br>  pages={70-85},
<br>  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have the potential 
to significantly reduce the cost and time of making last-mile deliveries
 and responding to emergencies. Despite this potential, little work has 
gone into developing vehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for 
drone delivery scenarios. Existing VRPs are insufficient for planning 
drone deliveries: either multiple trips to the depot are not permitted, 
leading to solutions with excess drones, or the effect of battery and 
payload weight on energy consumption is not considered, leading to 
costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multitrip VRPs for drone 
delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject to a 
delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time
 subject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and 
experimentally validate an energy consumption model for multirotor 
drones, demonstrating that energy consumption varies approximately 
linearly with payload and battery weight. We use this approximation to 
derive mixed integer linear programs for our VRPs. We propose a cost 
function that considers our energy consumption model and drone reuse, 
and apply it in a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for finding 
suboptimal solutions to practical scenarios. To assist drone delivery 
practitioners with balancing cost and delivery time, the SA heuristic is
 used to show that the minimum cost has an inverse exponential 
relationship with the delivery time limit, and the minimum overall 
delivery time has an inverse exponential relationship with the budget. 
Numerical results confirm the importance of reusing drones and 
optimizing battery size in drone delivery VRPs.},

<br>  abstract={This paper presents a visual saliency detection 
approach, which is a hybrid of local feature-based saliency and global 
feature-based saliency (simply called local saliency and global 
saliency, respectively, for short). First, we propose an automatic 
selection of smoothing parameter scheme to make the foreground and 
background of an input image more homogeneous. Then, we partition the 
smoothed image into a set of regions and compute the local saliency by 
measuring the color and texture dissimilarity in the smoothed regions 
and the original regions, respectively. Furthermore, we utilize the 
global color distribution model embedded with color coherence, together 
with the multiple edge saliency, to yield the global saliency. Finally, 
we combine the local and global saliencies, and utilize the composition 
information to obtain the final saliency. Experimental results show the 
efficacy of the proposed method, featuring: 1) the enhanced accuracy of 
detecting visual salient region and appearance in comparison with the 
existing counterparts, 2) the robustness against the noise and the 
low-resolution problem of images, and 3) its applicability to

designing fuzzy controllers, then the partly measurable premise

existing fuzzy control schemes, the fuzzy weight functions are 
unaccessible on line due to the partly immeasurable premise variables, 
so that the partly measurable premise variables cannot be directly used,

<br>  abstract={With the increase in driver assistance systems, driver 
models are becoming more important to vehicle control, driving safety, 
and performance. To make these driver assistance systems better 
cooperate with human drivers, the driver models need to be able to 
predict human driving behaviors and distinguish among different drivers.
 In this paper, a combined driver model consisting of a compensatory 
transfer function and an anticipatory component based on road geometry 
is integrated with the design of the individual driver's desired path. 
The proposed driver model parameters are obtained from human subject 
test data collected in a driving simulator. It has been shown that the 
proposed combined driver model is able to replicate each driver's 
steering wheel angle signals for a variety of maneuvers at different 
vehicle speeds. The driver model is then validated by first using a 
polynomial to interpolate the driver model and desired path parameters 
for an intermediate speed. It is also validated by comparing two 
different drivers' model parameter sets to show that each driver has a 
unique set of parameters. The final validation is to show that the 
proposed individual driver's desired path offers more accurate steering 
wheel fits than the previous geometric centerline.},

optimizing crew roster recovery (CRR) problems, in which rosters for

first formulated as combinational optimization problems containing 
multiple objectives and constraints, and a variant of the nondominated 
sorting genetic algorithm II method is used to explore Pareto solutions.
 To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a real-world 
rostering problem was studied. For the test instance, experimental 
results showed the advantages of the proposed approach compared with 
previous work in the literature. By simulating disruption events on the 
real-world rostering plan, we studied two recovery scenarios containing 
sufficient and insufficient available crews in the experiments. In 
particular, a constraint-loosening mechanism that conditionally replaced
 preallocated tasks with flight duties was proposed in a 
resource-shortage case to explore the Pareto solutions. The experimental
 results show that the proposed approach attains a favorable solution 
quality and can generate multiple recovery plans for decision makers.},

is designed for the attitude subsystem with unmatched disturbance and 
unknown dynamics so that in each step the virtual control is carefully

 established via Lyapunov approach. In simulation test, it is 
interesting to find out that continuous airdrop process will deteriorate
 the system stability if additional control effort is not exerted. The

<br>  abstract={Modeling and predicting human dynamic behaviors in the 
face of stress and uncertainty can help understand and prevent potential
 irrational behavior, such as panic buying or evacuations, in the wake 
of extreme events. However, in terms of the types of events and the 
distinct human psychological factors, such as risk perception (RP) and 
emotional intensity (EI), human dynamic behaviors exhibit heterogeneous 
spatiotemporal characteristics. For example, we can observe different 
collective responses to the same events by people in different regions, 
with distinct trends unfolding over time. To provide a computational 
means for understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of human 
behaviors during different types of extreme events, here we present a 
network-based model that enables us to characterize dynamic behaviors. 
This model assumes the perspective of a dynamic system, whose behavior 
is driven by human psychological factors and by the network structure of
 interactions among individuals. By making use of the available data 
from Twitter and GoogleTrends, we conduct a case study of human dynamic 
behavioral and emotional responses to the Japanese earthquake in 2011 in
 order to examine the effectiveness of our proposed model. With this 
model, we further assess the impacts of an event by evaluating the 
interrelationships of human RP and levels of EI in terms of observed 
collective behaviors. The results demonstrate that human behaviors are 
subjected to personal observations, experiences, and interactions, which
 can potentially alter perceptions and magnify the impacts of an 
event.},

<br>  abstract={In this paper, we present an adaptive control of robotic
 manipulators with parametric uncertainties and motion constraints. 
Position and velocity constraints are considered and they are unified 
and converted into the constraint of the nominal input. An adaptive 
neural network control is developed to achieve trajectory tracking, 
while the problems of motion constraints are addressed by considering 
the saturation effect of the nominal input. The uniform boundedness of 
all closed-loop signals is verified through Lyapunov analysis. 
Simulation and experiment results on a 2-degree-of-freedom robotic 
manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

investigated for a class of stochastic nonlinear time-varying delay 
systems under the weaker condition on nonlinear functions. The new 
parameter-dependent state and output feedback controllers are, 
respectively, proposed. Based on the stochastic time-delay system 
stability criterion, by tactfully introducing a suitable 
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the globally asymptotically stable in 
probability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by rigorous proof. 
As a practical application, the stochastic model of a two-stage chemical
 reactor system is established by reasonably introducing the Gaussian 
white noise. The developed approach is applied to the control design for
 this practical system. The simulation results demonstrate the 
efficiency of the proposed design approach.},
