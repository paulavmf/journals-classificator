<br>  abstract={In this paper, distributed optimization is addressed 
based on a continuous-time multiagent system in the presence of 
time-varying communication delays. First, the relationship between 
optimal solutions and the equilibrium points of the multiagent system 
with time delay is revealed. Next, delay-dependent and delay-independent
 sufficient conditions in form of linear matrix inequality are derived 
for ascertaining convergence to optimal solutions, in the cases of 
slow-varying delay and fast-varying delay. Furthermore, a set of 
conditions are also obtained for the delay-free case. In addition, a 
sampled-data communication scheme is presented based on the conditions 
for the fast varying delay systems. Simulation results are presented to 
substantiate the theoretical results. An application for distributed 
parameter estimation is also given.},

for a class of uncertain large-scale nonlinear systems with unknown dead

and stuck. It is assumed that the lower and upper bounds of actuator 
efficiency factor, the unparametrizable time-varying stuck fault, the 
system coefficient, and the uncertain functions of our considered 
systems are unknown. By introducing a smooth function, fuzzy logic 
systems and a bound estimation approach, a decentralized backstepping 
design method of fault-tolerant tracking controller is developed for the
 systems under consideration. The proposed controller can compensate the
 effects of actuator faults and dead zones completely. It is proved that
 all the signals in the closed-loop systems are ultimately bounded, and 
the tracking control performance can be achieved by the proposed 
controller. In comparing with the existing results, the restrictions on 
the number of failures are removed and the stuck fault is allowed to be 
time-varying. Finally, simulation results show the efficiency of the 
proposed control scheme.},

<br>  abstract={An adaptive consensus algorithm is proposed for a class 
of nonlinear multiagent systems with completely unknown agent dynamics. 
Due to uncertainties in the agent's dynamics, previous consensus 
approaches usually yield uniformly ultimately bounded consensus error. 
Our main contribution includes a novel robust consensus algorithm which 
can guarantee that the consensus error converges to zero asymptotically.
 In order to address the unknown dynamics, a two-layer neural network 
(NN) is utilized to learn the unknown dynamics in an online manner, and a
 robust continuous term is introduced to alleviate effects of the NN 
residual reconstruction error and external disturbances. The 
continuousness of the control signal is guaranteed to remove the 
actuator bandwidth requirement and avoid the caused chattering 
phenomenon. The proposed consensus algorithm is distributed in the sense
 that each agent only exchanges information with its neighbor agents. 
The asymptotic consensus result is achieved via Lyapunov synthesis. 
Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can also be extended to the case 
where the agents are required to form a prescribed formation. Finally, 
simulation studies on a nonlinear multiagent system are provided to 
demonstrate the performance of the scheme.},

existing DFDA works, we consider uncertain time-delayed interactions

fault detection scheme consisting of a local detection estimator and its
 corresponding time-varying detection threshold is presented for each

the proposed output-feedback DFDA scheme are thoroughly investigated in

<br>  abstract={Detecting and diagnosing unwanted behavior in multiagent
 systems (MASs) are crucial to ascertain correct operation of agents. 
Current techniques assume a priori knowledge to identify unexpected 
behavior. However, generation of MAS models is both error-prone and 
time-consuming, as it exponentially increases with the number of agents 
and their interactions. In this paper, we describe a light-weight, 
automatic debugging-based technique, coined extended spectrum-based 
fault localization for MAS (ESFL-MAS), that shortens the diagnostic 
process, while only relying on minimal information about the system. 
ESFL-MAS uses a heuristic that quantifies the suspiciousness of an agent
 to be faulty. Different heuristics may have a different impact on the 
diagnostic quality of ESFL-MAS. Our experimental evaluation shows that 
10 out of 42 heuristics (namely accuracy, coverage, Jaccard, Laplace, 
least contradiction, Ochiai, Rogers and Tanimoto, simple-matching, 
Sorensen-dice, and support) yield the best diagnostic accuracy (96.26% 
on average) in the context of the MAS used in our experiments.},

<br>  abstract={This paper proposes a control framework, called 
pulse-modulated intermittent control, which unifies impulsive control 
and sampled control. Specifically, the concept of pulse function is 
introduced to characterize the control/rest intervals and the amplitude 
of the control. By choosing some specified functions as the pulse 
function, the proposed control scheme can be reduced to sampled control 
or impulsive control. The proposed control framework is applied to 
consensus problems of multiagent systems. Using discretization 
approaches and stability theory, several necessary and sufficient 
conditions are established to ensure the consensus of the controlled 
system. The results show that consensus depends not only on the network 
topology, the sampling period and the control gains, but also the pulse 
function. Moreover, a lower bound of the asymptotic convergence factor 
is derived as well. For a given pulse function and an undirected graph, 
an optimal control gain is designed to achieve the fastest convergence. 
In addition, impulsive control and sampled control are revisited in the 
proposed control framework. Finally, some numerical examples are given 
to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

<br>  abstract={This paper introduces a Markov model for evolutionary

population. This interactive Markov model has the potential to provide 
tractable models for optimization problems of realistic size. We propose
 two simple discrete optimization search strategies with 
population-proportion-based selection and a modified mutation operator. 
The probability of selection is linearly proportional to the number of 
individuals at each point of the search space. The mutation operator 
randomly modifies an entire individual rather than a single decision 
variable. We exactly model these optimization search strategies with 
interactive Markov models. We present simulation results to confirm the 
interactive Markov model theory. We show that genetic algorithms and 
biogeography-based optimization perform better with the addition of 
population-proportion-based selection on a set of real-world benchmarks.
 We note that many other EAs, both new and old, might be able to be 
improved with this addition, or modeled with this method.},

 framework for automatic extraction of human understandable fuzzy rules

framework to simultaneously identify useful determinants (attributes) of
 faults and fuzzy rules using those attributes. At the beginning of the 
training, the system assumes every attribute (feature) as a useless 
feature and then uses a concept of feature attenuating gate to select 
useful features. The learning process opens the gates or closes them 
more tightly based on utility of the features. Our system can discard 
derogatory and indifferent attributes and select the useful ones. It can
 also exploit subtle nonlinear interaction between attributes. In order 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we have used several

<br>  abstract={Traffic congestion is not only a cause of nuisance for 
general commuters but also a factor that has a measurable impact on the 
economy if not handled proactively. When congestion increases, the 
waiting time for commuters increases which results in wasted fuel and 
wasted time. Wasted fuel adds to the import bill of a country and lost 
time results in loss of productivity. Traffic can be regulated at 
various points in order to reduce congestion and eliminate bottleneck 
areas. In this paper, we propose the use of conventional scheduling to 
regulate traffic at intersections in order to reduce congestion. We 
propose minimum destination distance first (MDDF) and minimum average 
destination distance first (MADDF) algorithms and compare them with some
 of the relevant existing scheduling algorithms. The proposed algorithms
 can not only be easily implemented on low cost hardware but also show 
better performance and outperform the existing algorithms that are 
considered, based on simulation results. Simulation results show that 
the MDDF and MADDF algorithms reduce the traffic congestion at 
intersections by up to 80% in some cases compared to static traffic 
lights.},

most industries, especially in the semiconductor industry. Effective

multiagent systems (MASs) with Lipschitz-type nonlinear dynamics and 
directed switching topology. Unlike most existing works where the 
relative full state measurements of neighboring agents are utilized, it 
is assumed that only the relative output measurements of neighboring 
agents are available for coordination. To achieve consensus tracking in 
the considered MASs, a new class of observer-based protocols is 
proposed. By appropriately constructing some topology-dependent multiple
 Lyapunov functions, it is theoretically shown that distributed 
consensus tracking in the closed-loop MASs equipped with the designed 
protocols can be ensured if each possible topology contains a directed 
spanning tree rooted at the leader and the dwell time for the switchings
 among different topology is less than a derived positive quantity. 
Interestingly, it is found that the communication topology for 
observers' states may be independent with that of the feedback signals. 
The derived results are further extended to the case of directed 
switching topology with only average dwell time constraints. Finally, 
the effectiveness of the analytical results is demonstrated via 
numerical simulations.},
