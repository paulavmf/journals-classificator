 a class of neural networks with weights identification and time delays.
 In module-phase synchronization, complex-valued node states are taken 
into consideration. The topology weights considered here are uncertain 
and the time delays are bounded. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii 
functional and employing adaptive feedback control, sufficient 
conditions for module-phase synchronization are derived. After the 
general synchronization theory, the synchronization with topology 
identification is discussed. Finally, pertinent examples are given to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

<br>  abstract={Gramophone records were the main recording medium for 
more than seven decades and regained widespread popularity over the past
 several years. Being an analog storage medium, gramophone records are 
subject to distortions caused by scratches, dust particles, degradation,
 and other means of improper handling. The observed noise often leads to
 an unpleasant listening experience and requires a filtering process to 
remove the unwanted disruptions and improve the audio quality. This 
paper proposes a novel approach that employs various feed forward time 
delay artificial neural networks to detect and reconstruct noise in 
musical sound waves. A set of 800 songs from eight different genres were
 used to validate the performance of the neural networks. The 
performance was analyzed according to the outlier detection and 
interpolation accuracy, the computational time and the tradeoff between 
the accuracy and the time. The empirical results of both detection and 
reconstruction neural networks were compared to a number of other 
algorithms, including various statistical measurements, duplication 
approaches, trigonometric processes, polynomials, and time series 
models. It was found that the neural networks' outlier detection 
accuracy was slightly lower than some of the other noise identification 
algorithms, but achieved a more efficient tradeoff by detecting most of 
the noise in real time. The reconstruction process favored neural 
networks with an increase in the interpolation accuracy compared to 
other widely used time series models. It was also found that certain 
genres such as classical, country, and jazz music were interpolated more
 accurately. Volatile signals, such as electronic, metal, and pop music 
were more challenging to reconstruct and were substantially better 
interpolated using neural networks than the other examined algorithms.},

<br>  abstract={Physical infrastructures are commonly composed of 
interconnected and intra- and interdependent subsystems, which in their 
essence constitute systems-of-systems (S-o-S) with multiple functions, 
operations, and stakeholders. Their complexity is characterized by 
highly interconnected and interdependent physical, cyber, 
organizational, and economic subsystems through shared resources, 
decisions, and states. This paper explores potential sources of systemic
 risks in complex S-o-S by analyzing unique failure modes of such 
systems in a nonlinear dynamic multiobjective sequential decision-making
 process. We posit that certain preferences of decision-makers when 
choosing among multiple competing objectives may reduce the safety 
margin of a specific subsystem within the S-o-S to withstand unexpected 
external perturbations due to the interdependencies manifested by shared
 states among the subsystems. This can contribute to the failure of an 
entire S-o-S even though all decisions are made based on 
Pareto-optimality. By quantifying the level of subsystem interdependency
 caused by shared states, this paper develops a method to mitigate such 
systemic risks through decomposing and coordinating the interconnected 
subsystems of an S-o-S in a decentralized way. The implication of the 
proposed theory is demonstrated using an illustrative example of a 
highway bridge S-o-S.},

<br>  abstract={The existing economic production quantity (EPQ) models 
in imperfect production systems normally assume either deteriorating 
production processes or deteriorating inventory. In this paper, the two 
aspects are combined together in a single approach to solve single 
machine, single product EPQ problem. There are assumed to be two states:
 1) in-control and 2) out-of-control state. At the beginning of each 
production cycle, the production process is in control with a low 
defective rate. After a certain time period, the production process 
switches from an in-control to an out-of-control state. As a result, the
 defect rate increases to another level and more defective items are 
produced. Defective products are reworked after the normal production 
process all together but before that they are stored in an inventory, so
 a corresponding inventory holding cost is generated. Backordering is 
also considered in this model and products are first used to satisfy the
 backlog demand in each production run. Three different cases are 
considered and discussed in which the switch of state occurs in the 
backlog period, the inventory surplus period, and after the normal 
production period, respectively. By finding the optimal total production
 and backlog quantity, the expected total cost per unit product is 
minimized.},

<br>  abstract={The available human body inertial motion capture (MoCap)
 systems are aided by magnetometers to remove the drift error in yaw 
angle estimation, which in turn limits their application in the presence
 of long-lasting magnetic disturbances in indoor environments. This 
paper introduces a magnetometer-free algorithm for lower-body MoCap 
including 3-D localization and posture tracking by fusing inertial 
sensors with an ultrawideband (UWB) localization system and a 
biomechanical model of the human lower body. Using our novel Kalman 
filter-based fusion algorithm, the UWB localization data aided by the 
biomechanical model can eliminate the drift in inertial yaw angle 
estimation of the lower-body segments. This magnetometer-free yaw angle 
estimation makes the algorithm insensitive to the magnetic disturbances.
 The algorithm is benchmarked against the optical MoCap system for 
various indoor activities including walking, jogging, jumping, and 
stairs ascending/descending. The results show that the proposed 
algorithm outperforms the available magnetometer-aided algorithms in yaw
 angle tracking under magnetic disturbances. In a uniform magnetic 
field, the algorithm shows similar accuracies in localization and joint 
angle tracking when compared with the magnetometer-aided methods. The 
localization accuracy of the proposed method is better than 4.5 cm in a 
3-D space and its accuracy for knee angle tracking is about 3.5° and 
4.5° in low and high dynamic motions, respectively.},

model: the model takes into account the influence of environmental 
conditions using the measurements of sunlight intensity, the moonlight, 
tide levels, precipitation, and water salinity levels. A possible 
influence of the internal circadian/circatidal clocks is also analyzed

paper, it is demonstrated that the developed dynamical model of the

detecting perturbations of these rhythms due to changes in the water

<br>  volume={47},
<br>  number={6},
<br>  pages={950-964},
<br>  abstract={Visual target tracking has made significant advances in 
past decades. However, fast and robust vision target tracking systems 
are still greatly demanded. This paper proposes a novel high-speed 
target tracking system based on hierarchical parallel vision processor 
architecture. This system contains three main parts: 1) a CMOS image 
sensor; 2) a vision processor; and 3) an actuator with two degrees of 
freedom. The vision processor integrates a pixel-parallel processing 
element (PE) array, a row-parallel row processor (RP) array, dual-core 
microprocessor unit (MPU) and motor controller. The PE array and RP 
array can speed up low-level and middle-level image processing 
operations by O(M<sup>2</sup>) and O(M), respectively. The MPU is 
responsible for the high-level image processing and the overall chip 
management. A novel tracking algorithm based on a gray-level local 
binary pattern descriptor is proposed. The descriptor describes not only
 local texture feature but also distribution of luminance. The algorithm
 increases the robustness of the tracking system under low resolution 
scenery and complex background. It can be carried out by the vision 
processor with very high efficiency. Experiment results demonstrate that
 the system can track a fast moving target under complex conditions and 
the vision processor can achieve over 2000 frames/s processing speed of 
the target tracking algorithm with 750×480 image resolution.},

<br>  abstract={In mobile crowdsensing (MCS), one of the participants' 
main concerns is the cost for 3G data usage, which affects their 
willingness to participate in a crowdsensing task. In this paper, we 
present the design and implementation of an MCS data uploading 
mechanism-ecoSense-to help reduce additional 3G data cost incurred by 
the whole crowd of sensing participants. By considering the two most 
common real-life 3G price plans-unlimited data plan (UnDP) and pay as 
you go (PAYG), ecoSense partitions all the users into two groups 
corresponding to these two price plans at the beginning of each month, 
with the objective of minimizing the total refunding budget for all 
participants. The partitioning is based on predicting users' mobility 
patterns and sensed data size. The ecoSense mechanism is designed 
inspired by the observation that during the data uploading cycles, UnDP 
users could opportunistically relay PAYG users' data to the crowdsensing
 server without extra 3G cost, provided the two types of users are able 
to “meet” on a common local cost-free network (e.g., Bluetooth or WiFi 
direct). We conduct our experiments using both the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology reality mining and the Small World In Motion 
(SWIM) simulation data sets. Evaluation results show that ecoSense could
 reduce total 3G data cost by up to ~50%, when compared to the 
direct-assignment method that assigns each participant to UnDP or PAYG 
directly according to the size of her sensed data.},

<br>  abstract={Mass media sources, specifically the news media, have 
traditionally informed us of daily events. In modern times, social media
 services such as Twitter provide an enormous amount of user-generated 
data, which have great potential to contain informative news-related 
content. For these resources to be useful, we must find a way to filter 
noise and only capture the content that, based on its similarity to the 
news media, is considered valuable. However, even after noise is 
removed, information overload may still exist in the remaining 
data-hence, it is convenient to prioritize it for consumption. To 
achieve prioritization, information must be ranked in order of estimated
 importance considering three factors. First, the temporal prevalence of
 a particular topic in the news media is a factor of importance, and can
 be considered the media focus (MF) of a topic. Second, the temporal 
prevalence of the topic in social media indicates its user attention 
(UA). Last, the interaction between the social media users who mention 
this topic indicates the strength of the community discussing it, and 
can be regarded as the user interaction (UI) toward the topic. We 
propose an unsupervised framework-SociRank-which identifies news topics 
prevalent in both social media and the news media, and then ranks them 
by relevance using their degrees of MF, UA, and UI. Our experiments show
 that SociRank improves the quality and variety of automatically 
identified news topics.},

bottom-up multiagent approach is applied to model the interactions

 of 10 years data from Tianya.cn, which are further validated through 
the artificial community using computational experimental leverages. 
Experimental results illuminate that the individual's post publishing 
behavior is dominated by agent's psychological states, while the comment
 publishing behavior is more susceptible to the agent's social 
environment expressing the collective efforts of topics and other agents
 in the community. The artificial community has been used to test the 
impact of several factors (e.g., individual's psychological state, 
number of initial agents, and number of new added agents) to

<br>  abstract={Effectiveness is the most important factor considered in
 the ranking models yielded by algorithms of learning to rank (LTR). 
Most of the related ranking models only focus on improving the average 
effectiveness but ignore robustness. When a ranking model ignores 
robustness, the effectiveness for many queries is possibly very poor 
although the average effectiveness for all queries is relatively high. 
Therefore, Wang et al. first consider robustness in their ranking 
models. However, the robustness formula defined by Wang et al. cannot 
characterize those queries whose effectiveness are hurt seriously in 
comparison with the baseline model. In order to overcome this 
shortcoming, we propose a novel formula of characterizing robustness 
based on portfolio theory, and construct a multiobjective optimization 
model of the robust LTR in which the formula is used. Based on this 
model, we propose an approach of risk-sensitive and robust LTR, named as
 R<sup>2</sup>Rank, which is based on the framework of archived 
multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm and the idea of preference 
ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation. The experimental 
results show that the ranking models produced by our proposed R<sup>2</sup>Rank approach are better in both effectiveness and robustness than those produced by three state-of-the-art LTR approaches.},

driver assistance system. This correspondence paper investigates the 
driver's arm viscoelastic properties during steering vehicle maneuver. 
First, a time-varying method for estimating driver's arm viscoelastic 
properties during driving the vehicle is proposed. Then, this method is 
implemented experimentally in order to examine the driver's arm 
viscoelastic properties during driving the vehicle. The estimation 
method does not require a specific perturbation torque to be applied 
during driving and could be applied online. The method is based on a 
time-varying model of the human driver's arm coupled with the electric 
power-assisted steering system model. Experiments were carried out with 
five healthy subjects who drove on a hardware-in-the-loop simulator 
without assistance and with assistance.},
