<br>  abstract={Owing to large production capacity and high efficiency, 
multibridge machining systems (MBMSs) have gained increasing attention 
in industry. Their multiple bridge machines work concurrently in their 
serially arranged and partially overlapping workspaces. To solve totally
 the job scheduling and collision resolution problems of MBMS, our prior
 work proposes a serial-colored traveling salesman problem 
(S-CTSP)-based method. Each salesman in S-CTSP visits his exclusive 
cities and some cities shared with his neighbor(s). To endow MBMS with 
fault-tolerance ability, this paper presents a two-stage method for both
 static path planning and dynamic collision avoidance of multiple 
machines. At the first stage, the path planning problem abstracted as an
 S-CTSP is solved by a population-based incremental learning (PBIL) 
algorithm. The PBIL introduces a local search operation, two types of 
possibility vectors, and a selection strategy of exclusive and shared 
cities. The second stage uses a Petri net supervisor to dynamically 
avoid any emerging collision when performing the scheduled work. This 
work also provides a novel priority net structure to prevent mutual 
waiting of two neighboring machines ready to enter their overlapping 
workspace. Then, we apply the presented method to a large tribridge 
waterjet cutting case to show its performance.},

 Case},

<br>  abstract={This paper deals with the consensus control problem for a
 class of nonlinear discrete time-varying stochastic multiagent systems 
(MASs) over a finite horizon via static output feedback. The measurement
 output available for the controller is not only from the individual 
agent itself but also from its neighboring ones according to the given 
topology. The nonlinearities described by statistical means can 
encompass several classes of well-studied nonlinearities in the 
literature. A new index of mean-square consensus performance, which 
quantifies the deviation level from the state of individual agent to the
 average value of all agents' states, is proposed to reflect the 
transient consensus behavior of the MAS. The purpose of the addressed 
problem is to design a time-varying output feedback controller such 
that: 1) the H<sub>∞</sub> consensus performance defined over a given 
finite horizon is guaranteed with respect to the additive noises and 2) 
at each time step, the mean-square consensus performance satisfies the 
prespecified upper bound constraint. By using a set of recursive matrix 
inequalities, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the
 desired control scheme for achieving both H<sub>∞</sub> and mean-square
 consensus performance requirements. Finally, a simulation example is 
utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed control 
protocol.},

<br>  abstract={It is well acknowledged that the opposing thumb granted 
humans advanced manipulation capabilities. However, such a feature is 
not statistically quantified, and its representation is not formally 
addressed in robotics yet. This paper studies whether the displacement 
of the opposing thumb in humans is a determining factor for shaping the 
grip. Using statistical analysis of the variability of motion capture 
data from the GRASP database, we found that the displacement of the 
thumb plays a leading role on the shaping of the grip, independently 
from the specific object being grasped. Furthermore, we map and compare 
the reachability spaces of the human thumb and two state-of-the-art 
robotic thumbs: (1) the shadow and (2) the iCub hands. We conclude that 
the kinematics of robotic thumbs does not evenly span the reachability 
space of the human thumb, favoring precision grasping motions. Hence, 
our findings contribute to the discussion of the optimal modeling of 
robotic hands.},

<br>  number={7},
<br>  pages={1071-1081},
<br>  abstract={In this paper, the H<sub>∞</sub> optimal control problem
 for a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems is investigated using 
event-triggered method. First, the H<sub>∞</sub> optimal control problem
 is formulated as a two-player zero-sum (ZS) differential game. Then, an
 adaptive triggering condition is derived for the ZS game with an 
event-triggered control policy and a time-triggered disturbance policy. 
The event-triggered controller is updated only when the triggering 
condition is not satisfied. Therefore, the communication between the 
plant and the controller is reduced. Furthermore, a positive lower bound
 on the minimal intersample time is provided to avoid Zeno behavior. For
 implementation purpose, the event-triggered concurrent learning 
algorithm is proposed, where only one critic neural network (NN) is used
 to approximate the value function, the control policy and the 
disturbance policy. During the learning process, the traditional 
persistence of excitation condition is relaxed using the recorded data 
and instantaneous data together. Meanwhile, the stability of closed-loop
 system and the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the critic NN's 
parameters are proved by using Lyapunov technique. Finally, simulation 
results verify the feasibility to the ZS game and the corresponding H<sub>∞</sub> control problem.},

Scheduling of Periodic Tasks Based on DES Supervisory Control},

<br>  volume={47},
<br>  number={7},
<br>  pages={1082-1098},
<br>  abstract={This paper presents a general discrete-event system 
(DES)-based hard periodic real-time task model. Based on supervisory 
control theory (SCT), an optimal priority-free real-time scheduling 
technique is proposed to process all the tasks running in uniprocessor 
or multiprocessor real-time systems (RTS). The preemption relation in 
this paper generalizes priority-based preemption. First, regular 
languages are utilized to describe the processor behavior related to 
each task's execution. Thereafter, the languages are represented by DES 
generators. Finally, the global processor behavior is generated as the 
synchronous product of these DES generators. By discarding the 
priorities, a novel preemption policy, namely conditional-preemption, is
 developed. Two sets of conditional-preemption specifications are 
developed, on the processor level and task level, respectively. 
Moreover, in order to control the system to be nonblocking and also 
limit the worst-case response time of the tasks, two corresponding sets 
of specifications are presented. After generating the global 
specification as the synchronous product, by implementing SCT the 
calculated supervisor can provide all the safe real-time execution 
sequences. The supervisor calculation can be sped up by a three-step 
algorithm. Finally, the real-time scheduling is implemented for 
real-world examples.},

<br>  pages={1099-1110},
<br>  abstract={We model information dissemination as a 
susceptible-infected epidemic process and formulate a problem to jointly
 optimize seeds for the epidemic and time varying resource allocation 
over the period of a fixed duration campaign running on a social network
 with a given adjacency matrix. Individuals in the network are grouped 
according to their centrality measure and each group is influenced by an
 external control function-implemented through advertisements-during the
 campaign duration. The aim is to maximize an objective function which 
is a linear combination of the reward due to the fraction of informed 
individuals at the deadline, and the aggregated cost of applying 
controls (advertising) over the campaign duration. We also study a 
problem variant with a fixed budget constraint. We set up the optimality
 system using Pontryagin's maximum principle from optimal control theory
 and solve it numerically using the forward-backward sweep technique. 
Our formulation allows us to compare the performance of various 
centrality measures (pagerank, degree, closeness, and betweenness) in 
maximizing the spread of a message in the optimal control framework. We 
find that degree-a simple and local measure-performs well on the three 
social networks used to demonstrate results: 1) scientific 
collaboration; 2) Slashdot; and 3) Facebook. The optimal strategy 
targets central nodes when the resource is scarce, but noncentral nodes 
are targeted when the resource is in abundance. Our framework is general
 and can be used in similar studies for other disease or information 
spread models-that can be modeled using a system of ordinary 
differential equations-for a network with a known adjacency matrix.},

<br>  abstract={Digital signal processing algorithms are widely adopted 
in motor bearing fault diagnosis. However, most algorithms are developed
 on desktop platforms, and their focus is on the analysis of offline 
captured signals. In this paper, a simple and easily implemented 
algorithm running on an embedded system is proposed for the online fault
 diagnosis of motor bearing. The core part of the algorithm is a 
stochastic-resonance-based adaptive filter that realizes signal 
denoising and adaptation of the filter coefficient. Processed by the 
filter, the period of the purified signal is obtained, and then the 
fault type of the motor bearing is identified. The proposed method has 
distinct merits, such as low computational cost, online implementation, 
contactless measurement, and availability for various speed motors. This
 paper provides a simple, flexible, and effective solution for 
conducting motor bearing diagnosis on an embedded/portable device. The 
algorithm proposed is validated by a brushless dc motor and a brushed dc
 motor fabricating with defective/healthy support bearings.},

required for the multiarm robot manipulation to tackle unknown

requirement that the deadzone nonlinearity in the sensor channel could 
be ignored. However, the sensor deadzone is widely spread in real world 
applications; and its existence significantly limits the robotic 
performances. Moreover, the kinematics and dynamics of the manipulated 
object cannot be accurately known as the prior knowledge. Hence, such 
robotic systems may not be perfectly controlled by conventional 
approaches. In this paper, a coordinated motion/force control method is 
presented to handle unknown sensor deadzone and object's uncertainty. 
The proposed method ensures the motion and internal force errors be 
bounded in a small neighborhood around the origin. Finally, comparative

<br>  abstract={This paper presents an adaptive particle swarm 
optimization with supervised learning and control (APSO-SLC) for the 
parameter settings and diversity maintenance of particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) to adaptively choose parameters, while improving its 
exploration competence. Although PSO is a powerful optimization method, 
it faces such issues as difficult parameter setting and premature 
convergence. Inspired by supervised learning and predictive control 
strategies from machine learning and control fields, we propose APSO-SLC
 that employs several strategies to address these issues. First, we 
treat PSO with its optimization problem as a system to be controlled and
 model it as a dynamic quadratic programming model with box constraints.
 Its parameters are estimated by the recursive least squares with a 
dynamic forgetting factor to enhance better parameter setting and weaken
 worse ones. Its optimal parameters are calculated by this model to feed
 back to PSO. Second, a progress vector is proposed to monitor the 
progress rate for judging whether premature convergence happens. By 
studying the reason of premature convergence, this work proposes the 
strategies of back diffusion and new attractor learning to extend swam 
diversity, and speed up the convergence. Experiments are performed on 
many benchmark functions to compare APSO-SLC with the state-of-the-art 
PSOs. The results show that it is simple to program and understand, and 
can provide excellent and consistent performance.},

<br>  abstract={In this paper, the dynamic output-feedback control 
problem is studied for a class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic 
systems with successive packet dropouts and uniform quantization 
effects. The stochastic system under investigation involves state-, 
control-, and disturbance-dependent noises (also called (x, u, 
v)-dependent noises) that bring in substantial difficulties in the 
stability analysis. The phenomenon of successive packet dropouts is 
governed by a binary switching random sequence. The measurement output 
is subject to the uniform quantization which results in the norm-bounded
 disturbances, and the concept of input-to-state stability in 
probability is introduced to deal with this kind of disturbances. In 
virtue of intensive stochastic analysis, several sufficient conditions 
are established to guarantee that the closed-loop system is 
input-to-state stable in probability under the effects of probabilistic 
packet dropouts as well as uniform quantizations. As an easy 
consequence, the design problem with linear output-feedback controllers 
is discussed for the benefits of practical applications and some 
simplified conditions are derived. Finally, a numerical example is 
presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

<br>  abstract={The development of complex self-adaptive systems has 
accelerated rapidly over the past decade, led by the Department of 
Defense, which has sought to develop and field military systems, such as
 unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, with elevated 
levels of autonomy to accomplish their mission with reduced funding and 
manpower. As their role increases, such systems must be able to adapt 
and learn, and make nondeterministic decisions. To field such systems 
requires extensive testing, evaluation, verification, and validation-a 
challenging task. To address this, we apply a novel systems perspective 
to develop a framework to predict future system performance based on the
 complexity of the operating environment using newly introduced 
complexity measures and learned costs. In this paper, we consider an 
autonomous military ground robot navigating in complex off-road 
environments. Using our model and experimental data from Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency-led experiments, we demonstrate the 
accuracy with which our model can predict system performance and then 
validate our model against other experimental results.},

<br>  abstract={In this paper, a dynamic leader selection process of a 
multirobot system with leader-follower strategies is studied in terms of
 formation control. A fuzzy inference system is employed to evaluate the
 status of robots by means of their states. Based on the status, an 
affection-based model is proposed to trigger a leader selection module. 
Followers send out unsatisfied signals when they are disappointed at the
 current leader. The abashment value of the leader changes with its own 
status as well as the number of unsatisfied signals received from its 
followers. When its abashment value goes beyond a given threshold, a 
leader reselection process is triggered. Moreover, a swap-greedy 
algorithm is proposed to approximate the optimal solution for confirming
 the leader-follower relationship, which can be described as a 
combinatorial optimization problem to minimize the total travel distance
 of all the robots. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the 
proposed model can improve the probability of a robot team escaping from
 local extreme points significantly, and even in the case of leader 
failure, the team can reselect a leader autonomously and keep moving 
toward the target.},

<br>  abstract={Bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problems in system and

reduction of variables (MRVs) is proposed. This method consists of a 
principle of variable classification, a procedure for problem

stochastic search engines. The classification principle is used to 
classify the decision variables of a BMI problem into two categories: 1)
 external and 2) internal variables. Theoretical analysis is performed 
to show that when the classification principle is applicable, a BMI 
problem can be transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem 
that has fewer decision variables. Stochastic search and deterministic 
search are then applied to determine the decision variables of the 
unconstrained problem externally and explore the internal problem 
structure, respectively. The proposed method can address feasibility, 
single-objective, and multiobjective problems constrained by BMIs in a 
unified manner. A number of numerical examples in system and control 
designs are provided to validate the proposed methodology. Simulations 
show that the MRVs can outperform existing BMI solution methods in most 
benchmark problems and achieve similar levels of performance in the 
remaining problems.},

based on the estimation of optimal weight vectors, the switched fuzzy

<br>  abstract={This paper proposes a global cooperative control 
framework to address leader-follower consensus of constraints subsystems
 of industrial plants, in which each subsystem is modeled as an agent 
and all the subsystems and networks of information flow construct a 
multiagent system. The focus of this paper is to solve the global 
leader-follower consensus for multiagent systems with input saturation 
via low-high gain feedback approach and parametric algebraic Riccati 
equation approach, in which the feedback gain design is distributed and 
decoupled from network topologies. By introducing appropriate 
assumptions, a class of low-high gain feedback protocol is designed 
based on the states of local neighbors to reach the global stability. It
 is proved in the sense of Lyapunov that, if the dwell time is larger 
than a positive threshold, the global leader-follower consensus for the 
closed-loop linear multiagent systems with input saturation under the 
derived topology containing a directed spanning tree can be achieved. 
The results are further extended to leader-follower consensus for 
nonlinear multiagent systems with the design of nonlinear low-high gain 
feedback protocol. As industrial applications of the proposed low-high 
gain scheduling approaches, the controller design of vibration in 
mechanical systems and satellite formation systems are revisited. 
Numerical simulations with cooperative control of industries subsystems

cycle/fabrication time (order of months). Reconfigurable analog circuits
 called field-programmable analog arrays (FPAAs) have been used to

FPAA to implement the path-planning algorithm. Experimental results and 
analysis are presented for 24 environment scenarios. Digital search
