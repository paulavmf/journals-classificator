<br>  abstract={Cloud computing has emerged as a very flexible service 
paradigm by allowing users to require virtual machine (VM) resources 
on-demand and allowing cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide VM 
resources via a pay-as-you-go model. This paper addresses the CSP's 
problem of efficiently allocating VM resources to physical machines 
(PMs) with the aim of minimizing the energy consumption. Traditional 
energy-aware VM allocations either allocate VMs to PMs in a centralized 
manner or implement VM migrations for energy reduction without 
considering the migration cost in cloud computing systems. We address 
these two issues by introducing a decentralized multiagent (MA)-based VM
 allocation approach. The proposed MA works by first dispatching a 
cooperative agent to each PM to assist the PM in managing VM resources. 
Then, an auction-based VM allocation mechanism is designed for these 
agents to decide the allocations of VMs to PMs. Moreover, to tackle 
system dynamics and avoid incurring prohibitive VM migration overhead, a
 local negotiation-based VM consolidation mechanism is devised for the 
agents to exchange their assigned VMs for energy cost saving. We 
evaluate the efficiency of the MA approach by using both static and 
dynamic simulations. The static experimental results demonstrate that 
the MA can incur acceptable computation time to reduce system energy 
cost compared with traditional bin packing and genetic algorithm-based 
centralized approaches. In the dynamic setting, the energy cost of the 
MA is similar to that of benchmark global-based VM consolidation 
approaches, but the MA largely reduces the migration cost.},

<br>  abstract={Due to the robustness against the uncertainties, 
conventional sliding mode control (SMC) has been extensively developed 
for fault-tolerant control (FTC) system. However, the FTCs based on 
conventional SMC provide several disadvantages such as large transient 
state error, less robustness, and large chattering, that limit its 
application for real application. In order to enhance the performance, a
 novel adaptive third-order SMC, which combines a novel third-order 
sliding mode surface, a continuous strategy and an adaptation law, is 
proposed. Compared with other innovation approaches, the proposed 
controller has an excellent capability to tackle several types of 
actuator faults with an enhancing on robustness, precision, chattering 
reduction, and time of convergence. The proposed method is then applied 
for an attitude control of a spacecraft and the results demonstrate the 
superior performance.},

<br>  year={2017},
<br>  volume={47},
<br>  number={2},
<br>  pages={229-237},
<br>  abstract={In this paper, we are concerned with the use of 
simulation optimization to handle collaborative design problems where 
more than one decision-maker is involved. We assume that the designers 
cannot enumerate all their considerations in closed-form, precise 
mathematical expressions but they can examine the merits of solutions 
with respect to their preferences and can compare candidate solutions 
with one another. We propose a three-stage framework to take the 
decision-makers' such considerations into account. The first step is to 
obtain a diverse set of designs that can all be considered efficient in 
terms of a performance metric (i.e., the objective function values of 
the simulation optimization model). These solutions are then passed on 
to the decision-makers to be analyzed in terms of their preferences that
 could not have been previously considered. Finally, the most 
appropriate solution is chosen. We address the problem encountered in 
the first step as a multimodal optimization problem. We address the 
second and the third subproblems as a preference aggregation problem in 
the social choice theory. We also illustrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed approach through a supply chain design problem inspired from 
the literature. We use the crowding clustering genetic algorithm as an 
example to demonstrate the first step. We use a multiplicative variant 
of the popular analytic hierarchy process to illustrate how the second 
and the third steps can be handled.},

<br>  year={2017},
<br>  volume={47},
<br>  number={2},
<br>  pages={238-254},
<br>  abstract={The aim of this paper is to design and develop an 
optimal motion cueing algorithm (MCA) based on the genetic algorithm 
(GA) that can generate high-fidelity motions within the motion 
simulator's physical limitations. Both, angular velocity and linear 
acceleration are adopted as the inputs to the MCA for producing the 
higher order optimal washout filter. The linear quadratic regulator 
(LQR) method is used to constrain the human perception error between the
 real and simulated driving tasks. To develop the optimal MCA, the 
latest mathematical models of the vestibular system and simulator motion
 are taken into account. A reference frame with the center of rotation 
at the driver's head to eliminate false motion cues caused by rotation 
of the simulator to the translational motion of the driver's head as 
well as to reduce the workspace displacement is employed. To improve the
 developed LQR-based optimal MCA, a new strategy based on optimal 
control theory and the GA is devised. The objective is to reproduce a 
signal that can follow closely the reference signal and avoid false 
motion cues by adjusting the parameters from the obtained LQR-based 
optimal washout filter. This is achieved by taking a series of factors 
into account, which include the vestibular sensation error between the 
real and simulated cases, the main dynamic limitations, the human 
threshold limiter in tilt coordination, the cross correlation 
coefficient, and the human sensation error fluctuation. It is worth 
pointing out that other related investigations in the literature 
normally do not consider the effects of these factors. The proposed 
optimized MCA based on the GA is implemented using the MATLAB/Simulink 
software. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed GA-based 
method in enhancing human sensation, maximizing the reference shape 
tracking, and reducing the workspace usage.},

 a new occlusion descriptor is proposed to distinguish occluded signs

<br>  abstract={There is an increasing use of social interaction 
contexts in the cross-enterprise manufacturing problem solving. To 
transform these massive and unstructured data into decision-support 
information for cross-enterprise manufacturing demand-capability

relationships based on a semi-supervised learning approach to derive 
formalized heterogeneous manufacturing network from the unstructured 
text-based context that contains high levels of noise and irrelevant 
information and (2) matching group-level relationships among the 
entities in the established manufacturing network. The extracting phase 
formulates network data using multiattributed graph that can encode 
various entities and relationships. The matching phase is based on 
probabilistic multiattributed graph matching, and implemented using 
distributed message passing algorithm. We developed a prototype system 
to verify the proposed model, which is also flexible to new domains of 
contexts and scale to large datasets. The ultimate goal of this paper is
 to facilitate knowledge transferring and sharing in the context of 
cross-enterprise social interaction, thereby supporting the integration

<br>  year={2017},
<br>  volume={47},
<br>  number={2},
<br>  pages={289-303},
<br>  abstract={High-dimensional data streams are becoming increasingly 
ubiquitous in industrial systems. Efficient detection of system faults 
from these data can ensure the reliability and safety of the system. The
 difficulties brought about by high dimensionality and data streams are 
mainly the âcurse of dimensionalityâ and concept drifting, and one 
current challenge is to simultaneously address them. To this purpose, 
this paper presents an approach to fault detection from nonstationary 
high-dimensional data streams. An angle-based subspace anomaly detection
 approach is proposed to detect low-dimensional subspace faults from 
high-dimensional datasets. Specifically, it selects fault-relevant 
subspaces by evaluating vectorial angles and computes the local 
outlier-ness of an object in its subspace projection. Based on the 
sliding window strategy, the approach is further extended to an online 
mode that can continuously monitor system states. To validate the 
proposed algorithm, we compared it with the local outlier factor-based 
approaches on artificial datasets and found the algorithm displayed 
superior accuracy. The results of the experiment demonstrated the 
efficacy of the proposed algorithm. They also indicated that the 
algorithm has the ability to discriminate low-dimensional subspace 
faults from normal samples in high-dimensional spaces and can be 
adaptive to the time-varying behavior of the monitored system. The 
online subspace learning algorithm for fault detection would be the main
 contribution of this paper.},

<br>  abstract={Population dynamics have been widely used in the design 
of learning and control systems for networked engineering applications, 
where the information dependency among elements of the network has 
become a relevant issue. Classic population dynamics (e.g., replicator, 
logit choice, Smith, and projection) require full information to evolve 
to the solution (Nash equilibrium). The main reason is that classic 
population dynamics are deduced by assuming well-mixed populations, 
which limits the applications where this theory can be implemented. In 
this paper, we extend the concept of population dynamics for 
nonwell-mixed populations in order to deal with distributed information 
structures that are characterized by noncomplete graphs. Although the 
distributed population dynamics proposed in this paper use partial 
information, they preserve similar characteristics and properties of 
their classic counterpart. Specifically, we prove mass conservation and 
convergence to Nash equilibrium. To illustrate the performance of the 
proposed dynamics, we show some applications in the solution of 
optimization problems, classic games, and the design of distributed 
controllers.},

techniques are developed to reduce the supervisor structure by 
compressing the number of control places. Finally, a number of examples
