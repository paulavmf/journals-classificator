<br>  abstract={Energy conservation and emission reduction in the 
ethylene industry is the main way to attain sustainable development, 
which can be achieved if the energy efficiency of petrochemical 
industries can be accurately analyzed and predicted. This paper proposes
 an improved radial basis function neural network based on fuzzy C-means
 (FCM) algorithm integrated with principal component analysis (PCA) 
technology (PCA-FRBF). The PCA is used to denoise and reduce dimensions 
of data to decrease the training time and errors of the modeling 
process. The FCM is used to separate every fuzzy class in input space 
and decide the number of neurons in hidden layer to overcome the 
shortcoming of setting them by experience subjectively. Meanwhile, the 
robustness and effectiveness of the PCA-FRBF model are validated through
 the standard data set from the University of California Irvine 
repository. Moreover, to predict the energy efficiency of ethylene 
plants, a multi-inputs and single-output model of energy efficiency is 
established based on the PCA-FRBF for monthly data of ethylene 
production process. We obtain a rational allocation of crude oil, fuel, 
steam, water, and electricity, and the greatest benefit of ethylene 
plants under different technologies. Finally, the empirical results show
 the effectiveness and practicability of the PCA-FRBF model applied to 
predict and guide the ethylene production in the petrochemical 
industry.},

Lyapunov function and slack matrices, a set of relaxed sufficient 
conditions are developed to guarantee that the unforced systems are 
admissible (regular, impulse free, and stable), which includes the 
existing related results as special cases. The developed conditions are 
expressed in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which is
 convenient for checking the admissibility. Then, a novel method is 
proposed to design an admissible fuzzy controller. Second, by applying 
the dissipativity theorem and Lyapunov stability theorem, a set of 
sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the resultant closed 
loop systems are admissible and dissipative, and the fuzzy controllers 
are designed using LMIs techniques. Finally, some examples are provided 
to illustrate that the main results in this paper are feasible and less

<br>  year={2017},
<br>  volume={47},
<br>  number={8},
<br>  pages={1785-1799},
<br>  abstract={Three-way decisions play an important role in rough sets
 and decision theory. As a representative model, decision-theoretic 
rough sets (DTRSs) provide a sound interpretation of thresholds used in 
three-way decisions. This problem is associated with the determination 
of the loss function of DTRSs. In this paper, we investigate a novel way
 of determining the loss functions of DTRSs with relative values. More 
specifically, with the aid of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, 
the determination of loss functions is realized in the context of DTRSs.
 First, a hierarchical structure of DTRSs is constructed. Second, along 
the hierarchical structure, pairwise comparison matrices are analyzed in
 a top-down fashion. In light of the generic condition imposed on the 
loss functions of DTRSs, some constraints on relative values between 
loss functions are introduced. The relative ratios at each level are 
computed. Considering the consistency ratio (CR) of the reciprocal 
matrices, two mathematical programming approaches are developed by 
exploiting the flexibility of information granularity. Then, we design a
 decision procedure for the determination of loss functions and deduce 
three-way decisions. The loss functions are calculated by aggregating 
the relative ratios being available at each level. With regard to the 
loss functions, we finally compare the existing studies with the AHP 
method. We demonstrate that the relative value with AHP improves the 
restriction of the existing studies and exhibits a certain level of 
tolerance to inconsistency.},

<br>  abstract={This paper focuses on graphic-based approaches and 
proposes a fuzzy knowledge-based disassembly process planning (FDPP) 
system for DPP. This FDPP system is based on a novel high-level Petri 
net (PN), termed fuzzy attributed and timed predicate/transition net 
(FATP/T net). An FATP/T net model for DPP is developed and the model is 
found very compact and general to any products, due to the comprehensive
 modeling capability and the inclusion of a bill of material component. 
It avoids issues such as unmanageable big model size and specific to a 
product, which are often found in the DPP models based on ordinary PNs. 
Another feature of the FATP/T net model is that it also includes a 
functional test operation to discern the usability of detached 
subassemblies/components. In addition, we have proposed a systemic 
approach to transform the FATP/T net model into an FDPP system to 
support DPP at a system level. A telephone kit is used as an example to 
illustrate the applicability of the FDPP system. The FDPP system is 
found flexible and expandable due to the independence of its 
components.},

<br>  abstract={Data stream monitoring provides the basis for building 
intelligent context-aware applications over contextual data streams. A 
number of wireless sensors could be spread in a specific area and

fire or flood. A back-end system receives measurements and derives 
decisions for possible abnormalities related to negative effects. We 
propose a mechanism which, based on multivariate sensors data streams, 
provides real-time identification of phenomena. The proposed framework 
performs contextual information fusion over consensus theory for the 
efficient measurements aggregation while time-series prediction is 
adopted to result future insights on the aggregated values. The 
unanimous fused and predicted pieces of context are fed into a type-2 
fuzzy inference system to derive highly accurate identification of 
events. The type-2 inference process offers reasoning capabilities under
 the uncertainty of the phenomena identification. We provide 
comprehensive experimental evaluation over real contextual data and 
report on the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed mechanism. 
Our mechanism is further compared with type-1 fuzzy inference and other 
mechanisms to demonstrate its false alarms minimization capability.},

developed in terms of a set of time-dependent differential linear matrix
 inequalities (LMIs) to make the closed-loop of the original ODE system 
finite-time quasi-contractively stable with an upper bound of quadratic 
cost function, while the temperature constraint is respected. 
Furthermore, by utilizing the time-convexity and LMI optimization 
techniques, a suboptimal controller is obtained by means of minimizing 
the guaranteed-cost bound. Finally, the proposed design method is 
applied to the control of a temperature constrained hypersonic rocket

<br>  pages={1965-1978},
<br>  abstract={Fault diagnosis, including fault detection and 
isolation, is a critical task for computer networks. Among the various 
techniques used for online system-level diagnosis, we are interested in 
the approach based on temporal information processing. The delays of the
 computer networks are inevitable, and the fault localization process 
has to take into account bounded delays or the temporal constraints. 
Temporal information is fundamental in model-based diagnosis. There can 
be cycles or loops in a computer network, but the fault reasoning 
methods for such cases are seldom considered in the literature. This 
paper provides an analytic model based on the cyclic temporal constraint
 network (CTCN), which aims at the fault diagnosis of cyclic computer 
networks using temporal information. The goal of the proposed framework 
is twofold: given the network structures and the predetermined candidate
 fault causes, the CTCN model corresponding the computer network under 
test is formulated; based on the CTCN model, given the alarms sequences 
with timestamps, the fault diagnosis process is executed to determine 
the most likely fault cause(s) with its/their time interval(s) of 
occurrence(s). The reasoning method is dependent on time point and time 
distance information, with which the fault motivators (i.e., actors) and
 fault responders (i.e., victims) can be identified. The calculation 
process consists of three steps: 1) establishment of the objective 
function; 2) determination of the fault propagation paths; and 3) 
determination of the expected states with a given fault hypothesis. 
Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated via an application study, 
and the effectiveness of our proposed method is verified.},

<br>  abstract={In this paper, a novel hybrid architecture is proposed 
for developing a prognosis and health monitoring methodology for 
nonlinear systems through integration of model-based and computationally
 intelligent-based techniques. In our proposed framework, the well-known
 particle filters (PFs) method is utilized to estimate the states as 
well as the health parameters of the system. Simultaneously, the system 
observations are predicted through an observation forecasting scheme 
that is developed based on neural networks (NNs) paradigms. The 
objective is to construct observation profiles that are to be used in 
future time horizons. Our proposed online training that is utilized for 
observation forecasting enables the NNs models to track nonergodic 
changes in the profiles that are present due to presence of hidden 
damage affecting the system health parameters. The forecasted 
observations are then utilized in the PFs to predict the evolution of 
the system states as well as the health parameters (which are considered
 to be time-varying due to effects of degradation and damage) into 
future time horizons. Our proposed hybrid architecture enables one to 
select health signatures for determining the remaining useful life of 
the system or its components not only based on the system observations 
but also by taking into account the system health parameters that are 
not physically measurable. Our proposed hybrid health monitoring 
methodology is constructed and developed by invoking a special framework
 where implementation of the observation forecasting scheme is not 
dependent on the structure of the utilized NNs model. In other words, 
changing the network structure will not significantly affect the 
prediction accuracy associated with the entire health prediction scheme.
 To verify and validate the above results and as a case study, our 
proposed hybrid approach is applied to predict the health condition of a
 gas turbine engine when it is affected by and subjected to fouling and 
erosion deg- adation and fault damages.},

imbalanced Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy classifier (IB-TSK-FC) for the TSK 
fuzzy classifier is presented to improve the classification performance

consists of two components: 1) a cross-class Bayesian fuzzy clustering

achieve high interpretability, BF3C is developed to determine an 
appropriate number of fuzzy rules and identify antecedent parameters of 
fuzzy rules from the perspective of the probabilistic model. In addition
 to inheriting the distinctive advantage of Bayesian fuzzy clustering 
that the number of clusters can be estimated in the framework of 
Bayesian inference, BF3C considers repulsion forces between cluster 
centers belonging to different classes, and uses an alternating 
iterative strategy to obtain more interpretable antecedent parameters 
for imbalanced datasets. In order to improve the classification 
performance for imbalanced datasets, an imbalance learning algorithm is 
derived to estimate consequent parameters of fuzzy rules on the basis of
 the weighted average misclassification error. Comprehensive experiments
 on synthetic and UCI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed IB-TSK-FC algorithm.},

<br>  abstract={Collective decision processes involve a large number of 
decision makers, demanding the consensus of different points of view 
about problems of several knowledge areas. The analysis and comparison 
of these points of view can contribute to this consensus, but they 
depend on the representation of each decision maker's individual 
knowledge about the problem. Mental models (MMs) are diagrammatic 
artifacts based on natural language which can be used to represent such 
knowledge. These models comprise logical cause-effect loops that are 
used to describe a problem as understood by each decision maker. This 
paper proposes an innovative tool based on a knowledge-based system of 
fuzzy rules which identifies MMs that best represent the consensus about
 the causes of a specific problem. Fuzzy rules were created, taking into
 account both, qualitative and quantitative variables. The tool was 
applied to the analysis and comparison of MMs of university students to 
describe the protests that occurred in Brazil between June and July 
2013. A comparison of results using Pareto analysis indicated that the 
tool identifies those MMs that best indicate the probable causes of the
