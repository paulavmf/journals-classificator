<br>  abstract={The extension of conventional clustering to hypergraph 
clustering, which involves higher order similarities instead of pairwise
 similarities, is increasingly gaining attention in computer vision. 
This is due to the fact that many clustering problems require an 
affinity measure that must involve a subset of data of size more than 
two. In the context of hypergraph clustering, the calculation of such 
higher order similarities on data subsets gives rise to hyperedges. 
Almost all previous work on hypergraph clustering in computer vision, 
however, has considered the smallest possible hyperedge size, due to a 
lack of study into the potential benefits of large hyperedges and 
effective algorithms to generate them. In this paper, we show that large
 hyperedges are better from both a theoretical and an empirical 
standpoint. We then propose a novel guided sampling strategy for large 
hyperedges, based on the concept of random cluster models. Our method 
can generate large pure hyperedges that significantly improve grouping 
accuracy without exponential increases in sampling costs. We demonstrate
 the efficacy of our technique on various higher-order grouping 
problems. In particular, we show that our approach improves the accuracy
 and efficiency of motion segmentation from dense, long-term, 
trajectories.},

<br>  abstract={Establishing dense correspondences between multiple 
images is a fundamental task in many applications. However, finding a 
reliable correspondence between multi-modal or multi-spectral images 
still remains unsolved due to their challenging photometric and 
geometric variations. In this paper, we propose a novel dense 
descriptor, called dense adaptive self-correlation (DASC), to estimate 
dense multi-modal and multi-spectral correspondences. Based on an 
observation that self-similarity existing within images is robust to 
imaging modality variations, we define the descriptor with a series of 
an adaptive self-correlation similarity measure between patches sampled 
by a randomized receptive field pooling, in which a sampling pattern is 
obtained using a discriminative learning. The computational redundancy 
of dense descriptors is dramatically reduced by applying fast edge-aware
 filtering. Furthermore, in order to address geometric variations 
including scale and rotation, we propose a geometry-invariant DASC 
(GI-DASC) descriptor that effectively leverages the DASC through a 
superpixel-based representation. For a quantitative evaluation of the 
GI-DASC, we build a novel multi-modal benchmark as varying photometric 
and geometric conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the 
outstanding performance of the DASC and GI-DASC in many cases of dense 
multi-modal and multi-spectral correspondences.},

<br>  volume={39},
<br>  number={9},
<br>  pages={1730-1743},
<br>  abstract={Both image segmentation and dense 3D modeling from 
images represent an intrinsically ill-posed problem. Strong regularizers
 are therefore required to constrain the solutions from being `too 
noisy'. These priors generally yield overly smooth reconstructions 
and/or segmentations in certain regions while they fail to constrain the
 solution sufficiently in other areas. In this paper, we argue that 
image segmentation and dense 3D reconstruction contribute valuable 
information to each other's task. As a consequence, we propose a 
mathematical framework to formulate and solve a joint segmentation and 
dense reconstruction problem. On the one hand knowing about the semantic
 class of the geometry provides information about the likelihood of the 
surface direction. On the other hand the surface direction provides 
information about the likelihood of the semantic class. Experimental 
results on several data sets highlight the advantages of our joint 
formulation. We show how weakly observed surfaces are reconstructed more
 faithfully compared to a geometry only reconstruction. Thanks to the 
volumetric nature of our formulation we also infer surfaces which cannot
 be directly observed for example the surface between the ground and a 
building. Finally, our method returns a semantic segmentation which is 
consistent across the whole dataset.},

<br>  pages={1744-1756},
<br>  abstract={Accurately determining the position and orientation from
 which an image was taken, i.e., computing the camera pose, is a 
fundamental step in many Computer Vision applications. The pose can be 
recovered from 2D-3D matches between 2D image positions and points in a 
3D model of the scene. Recent advances in Structure-from-Motion allow us
 to reconstruct large scenes and thus create the need for image-based 
localization methods that efficiently handle large-scale 3D models while
 still being effective, i.e., while localizing as many images as 
possible. This paper presents an approach for large scale image-based 
localization that is both efficient and effective. At the core of our 
approach is a novel prioritized matching step that enables us to first 
consider features more likely to yield 2D-to-3D matches and to terminate
 the correspondence search as soon as enough matches have been found. 
Matches initially lost due to quantization are efficiently recovered by 
integrating 3D-to-2D search. We show how visibility information from the
 reconstruction process can be used to improve the efficiency of our 
approach. We evaluate the performance of our method through extensive 
experiments and demonstrate that it offers the best combination of 
efficiency and effectiveness among current state-of-the-art approaches 
for localization.},

require little tuning, and the curve is validated against both synthetic

 within close Hausdorff distance to the ground truth, and has near 
identical tortuosity for helical objects with a circular profile. 
Parameter insensitivity and robustness against high levels of image

<br>  abstract={Current video event recognition research remains largely
 target-centered. For real-world surveillance videos, target-centered 
event recognition faces great challenges due to large intra-class target
 variation, limited image resolution, and poor detection and tracking 
results. To mitigate these challenges, we introduced a context-augmented
 video event recognition approach. Specifically, we explicitly capture 
different types of contexts from three levels including image level, 
semantic level, and prior level. At the image level, we introduce two 
types of contextual features including the appearance context features 
and interaction context features to capture the appearance of context 
objects and their interactions with the target objects. At the semantic 
level, we propose a deep model based on deep Boltzmann machine to learn 
event object representations and their interactions. At the prior level,
 we utilize two types of prior-level contexts including scene priming 
and dynamic cueing. Finally, we introduce a hierarchical context model 
that systematically integrates the contextual information at different 
levels. Through the hierarchical context model, contexts at different 
levels jointly contribute to the event recognition. We evaluate the 
hierarchical context model for event recognition on benchmark 
surveillance video datasets. Results show that incorporating contexts in
 each level can improve event recognition performance, and jointly 
integrating three levels of contexts through our hierarchical model 
achieves the best performance.},

<br> title={Improving Large-Scale Image Retrieval Through Robust Aggregation of Local Descriptors}, 
<br>  year={2017},
<br>  volume={39},
<br>  number={9},
<br>  pages={1783-1796},
<br>  abstract={Visual search and image retrieval underpin numerous 
applications, however the task is still challenging predominantly due to
 the variability of object appearance and ever increasing size of the 
databases, often exceeding billions of images. Prior art methods rely on
 aggregation of local scale-invariant descriptors, such as SIFT, via 
mechanisms including Bag of Visual Words (BoW), Vector of Locally 
Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and Fisher Vectors (FV). However, their 
performance is still short of what is required. This paper presents a 
novel method for deriving a compact and distinctive representation of 
image content called Robust Visual Descriptor with Whitening (RVD-W). It
 significantly advances the state of the art and delivers world-class 
performance. In our approach local descriptors are rank-assigned to 
multiple clusters. Residual vectors are then computed in each cluster, 
normalized using a direction-preserving normalization function and 
aggregated based on the neighborhood rank. Importantly, the residual 
vectors are de-correlated and whitened in each cluster before 
aggregation, leading to a balanced energy distribution in each dimension
 and significantly improved performance. We also propose a new post-PCA 
normalization approach which improves separability between the matching 
and non-matching global descriptors. This new normalization benefits not
 only our RVD-W descriptor but also improves existing approaches based 
on FV and VLAD aggregation. Furthermore, we show that the aggregation 
framework developed using hand-crafted SIFT features also performs 
exceptionally well with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based 
features. The RVD-W pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art global 
descriptors on both the Holidays and Oxford datasets. On the large scale
 datasets, Holidays1M and Oxford1M, SIFT-based RVD-W representation 
obtains a mAP of 45.1 and 35.1 percent, while CNN-based RVD-W achieve a 
mAP of 63.5 and 44.8 percent, all yielding superior performance to the -
 tate-of-the-art.},

<br>  abstract={We consider the design of an image representation that 
embeds and aggregates a set of local descriptors into a single vector. 
Popular representations of this kind include the bag-of-visual-words, 
the Fisher vector and the VLAD. When two such image representations are 
compared with the dot-product, the image-to-image similarity can be 
interpreted as a match kernel. In match kernels, one has to deal with 
interference, i.e., with the fact that even if two descriptors are 
unrelated, their matching score may contribute to the overall 
similarity. We formalise this problem and propose two related solutions,
 both aimed at equalising the individual contributions of the local 
descriptors in the final representation. These methods modify the 
aggregation stage by including a set of perdescriptor weights. They 
differ by the objective function that is optimised to compute those 
weights. The first is a âdemocratisationâ strategy that aims at 
equalising the relative importance of each descriptor in the set 
comparison metric. The second one involves equalising the match of a 
single descriptor to the aggregated vector. These concurrent methods 
give a substantial performance boost over the state of the art in image 
search with short or mid-size vectors, as demonstrated by our 
experiments on standard public image retrieval benchmarks.},

<br>  volume={39},
<br>  number={9},
<br>  pages={1825-1838},
<br>  abstract={Hashing has attracted a great deal of research in recent
 years due to its effectiveness for the retrieval and indexing of 
large-scale high-dimensional multimedia data. In this paper, we propose a
 novel ranking-based hashing framework that maps data from different 
modalities into a common Hamming space where the cross-modal similarity 
can be measured using Hamming distance. Unlike existing cross-modal 
hashing algorithms where the learned hash functions are binary space 
partitioning functions, such as the sign and threshold function, the 
proposed hashing scheme takes advantage of a new class of hash functions
 closely related to rank correlation measures which are known to be 
scale-invariant, numerically stable, and highly nonlinear. Specifically,
 we jointly learn two groups of linear subspaces, one for each modality,
 so that features' ranking orders in different linear subspaces 
maximally preserve the cross-modal similarities. We show that the 
ranking-based hash function has a natural probabilistic approximation 
which transforms the original highly discontinuous optimization problem 
into one that can be efficiently solved using simple gradient descent 
algorithms. The proposed hashing framework is also flexible in the sense
 that the optimization procedures are not tied upto any specific form of
 loss function, which is typical for existing cross-modal hashing 
methods, but ratherwe can flexibly accommodate different loss functions 
with minimal changes to the learning steps. We demonstrate through 
extensive experiments on four widely-used real-world multimodal datasets
 that the proposed cross-modal hashing method can achieve competitive 
performance against several state-of-the-arts with only moderate 
training and testing time.},

<br>  abstract={Domain adaptation is one of the most challenging tasks 
of modern data analytics. If the adaptation is done correctly, models 
built on a specific data representation become more robust when 
confronted to data depicting the same classes, but described by another 
observation system. Among the many strategies proposed, finding 
domain-invariant representations has shown excellent properties, in 
particular since it allows to train a unique classifier effective in all
 domains. In this paper, we propose a regularized unsupervised optimal 
transportation model to perform the alignment of the representations in 
the source and target domains. We learn a transportation plan matching 
both PDFs, which constrains labeled samples of the same class in the 
source domain to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at 
the same time the labeled samples in the source and the distributions 
observed in both domains. Experiments on toy and challenging real visual
 adaptation examples show the interest of the method, that consistently 
outperforms state of the art approaches. In addition, numerical 
experiments show that our approach leads to better performances on 
domain invariant deep learning features and can be easily adapted to the
 semi-supervised case where few labeled samples are available in the 
target domain.},

<br>  number={9},
<br>  pages={1866-1879},
<br>  abstract={Though many tasks in computer vision can be formulated 
elegantly as pixel-labeling problems, a typical challenge discouraging 
such a discrete formulation is often due to computational efficiency. 
Recent studies on fast cost volume filtering based on efficient 
edge-aware filters provide a fast alternative to solve discrete labeling
 problems, with the complexity independent of the support window size. 
However, these methods still have to step through the entire cost volume
 exhaustively, which makes the solution speed scale linearly with the 
label space size. When the label space is huge or even infinite, which 
is often the case for (subpixel-accurate) stereo and optical flow 
estimation, their computational complexity becomes quickly unacceptable.
 Developed to search approximate nearest neighbors rapidly, the 
PatchMatch method can significantly reduce the complexity dependency on 
the search space size. But, its pixel-wise randomized search and 
fragmented data access within the 3D cost volume seriously hinder the 
application of efficient cost slice filtering. This paper presents a 
generic and fast computational framework for general multi-labeling 
problems called PatchMatch Filter (PMF). We explore effective and 
efficient strategies to weave together these two fundamental techniques 
developed in isolation, i.e., PatchMatch-based randomized search and 
efficient edge-aware image filtering. By decompositing an image into 
compact superpixels, we also propose superpixel-based novel search 
strategies that generalize and improve the original PatchMatch method. 
Further motivated to improve the regularization strength, we propose a 
simple yet effective cross-scale consistency constraint, which handles 
labeling estimation for large low-textured regions more reliably than a 
single-scale PMF algorithm. Focusing on dense correspondence field 
estimation in this paper, we demonstrate PMF's applications in stereo 
and optical flow. Our PMF methods achieve top-tier correspondence accur-
 cy but run much fasterthan other related competing methods, often 
giving over 10-100 times speedup.},

<br>  abstract={Photometric stereo is widely used for 3D reconstruction.
 However, its use in scattering media such as water, biological tissue 
and fog has been limited until now, because of forward scattered light 
from both the source and object, as well as light scattered back from 
the medium (backscatter). Here we make three contributions to address 
the key modes of light propagation, under the common single scattering 
assumption for dilute media. First, we show through extensive 
simulations that single-scattered light from a source can be 
approximated by a point light source with a single direction. This 
alleviates the need to handle light source blur explicitly. Next, we 
model the blur due to scattering of light from the object. We measure 
the object point-spread function and introduce a simple deconvolution 
method. Finally, we show how imaging fluorescence emission where 
available, eliminates the backscatter component and increases the 
signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results in a water tank, with 
different concentrations of scattering media added, show that 
deconvolution produces higher-quality 3D reconstructions than previous 
techniques, and that when combined with fluorescence, can produce 
results similar to that in clear water even for highly turbid media.},

<br>  abstract={Most existing bottom-up algorithms measure the 
foreground saliency of a pixel or region based on its contrast within a 
local context or the entire image, whereas a few methods focus on 
segmenting out background regions and thereby salient objects. Instead 
of only considering the contrast between salient objects and their 
surrounding regions, we consider both foreground and background cues in 
this work. We rank the similarity of image elements with foreground or 
background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of image 
elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or 
queries. We represent an image as a multi-scale graph with fine 
superpixels and coarse regions as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on
 the similarity to background and foreground queries using affinity 
matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a cascade scheme to 
extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. 
Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs well 
against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We 
also propose a new benchmark dataset containing 5,168 images for 
large-scale performance evaluation of saliency detection methods.},
